                    BLACKPINK debuted on August 8, 2016, under YG Entertainment with their single album "Square One," 
                    featuring the tracks "Whistle" and "Boombayah." Both songs became instant hits, with "Whistle" 
                    topping Korean charts and "Boombayah" becoming the most-viewed K-pop debut music video at the time.

                    The group's name represents the idea that they aren't just pretty to look at—they have talent 
                    and personality, too. "Black" symbolizes their powerful performance style, while "Pink" represents 
                    their feminine, beautiful side. Together, they embody the duality that makes them unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, BLACKPINK has broken countless records, from being the first K-pop girl group to 
                    perform at Coachella to becoming the most-subscribed music group on YouTube. Their global influence 
                    extends beyond music, with each member establishing themselves as fashion icons and brand ambassadors 
                    for luxury brands worldwide.
